# FAIR and AI-ready datasets in High Energy Physics 

This repo includes example notebooks on how to use this [CMS H(bb) Open Dataset](http://opendata.cern.ch/record/12102). 

`HiggsToBB_H5_part1_data_visualization.ipynb` : provides basic information about the dataset, illustrates visualization of features and feature correlations.

`HiggsToBB_H5_part2_machine_learning_examples.ipynb`: presents two Machine Learning problems built on this dataset. The first one is a classifier to separate out the Higgs boson (Hbb) from background processes (QCD). The second one is a regression task to reconstruct the true energy of the Higgs Boson.
